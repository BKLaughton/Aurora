# Aurora Aeternis
Post apocalyptic setting based on a reversal of earth's magnetic poles, but told from the perspective of a small child, oblivious to the horror of it all as they make their way to a 'strong spot' in the unstable magnetosphere (on the advice of an elderly mentor doctor type). Probably an rpg/puzzle game.

## Original 'gritty' concept

When the skies lit, billions were bathed in lethal radiation. The grid went down, electronics overloaded, servers got wiped, planes and satellites literally fell out of the sky, navigations scrambled, not even compasses work. Television, radio, the internet: gone, just like that. Mass panic, looting, famine, then death. So much death. Above us, kaleidoscopic skies: aurorae. Few among us recognised what was going on, and the media wasn’t here to tell us. Some thought it was judgment day, hell on earth, heaven ablaze above. Souls floating away to the stars. Most commited suicide, the smart ones at least. Those that chose not to died slow, abominable deaths. Those of us that escaped dosage have little to be proud of, we’re mostly lucky. ‘Lucky’ might not be the word; we’re alive. We are the ones who were caught in the subway, in a carpark, deep underground or deep indoors. Most of us exposed ourselves anyway, or again, commited suicide. 

All that’s left now are the quick learners, good listeners, and the select few who already happened to be know a thing or two about geomagnetism and meteorology. Underground holdouts formed at first, but after most of the food was looted, we knew we had to move on. But where? Some knew, others raided libraries - there places, far away: stronger spots in the magnetosphere. Antarctica. Northern Canada. Siberia. South Western Australia. ‘Stronger’, but strong enough? It was all we had. We could couldn’t stay here. We had to hope. If it was all for nothing, we might as well die trying, instead of waiting. 

But how could we move overland, under the angry sky? Firstly, we move at night, when we can see the aurora, and take cover if it gets too bright. Secondly: Faraday cages, well Faraday suits to be precise. Let’s not kid ourselves, it was armour, and we needed it for this new dark age. At least firearms still work, though they’re about the only damn damn thing that does, and ammo has become a precious resource. Used as currency, for the rare occasion you meet strangers who aren’t trying rob you or eat you. Most of the time we used simpler, more reliable weapons. Scrap knights wielding junk, making an impossible pilgrimage to salvation that probably doesn’t even exist.

A far greater risk than the angry sky were other survivors. If not them, then nature herself. The radiation had poisoned her, and in the years since the unbinding, what had survived the angry sky had become like it: twisted and angry, beautiful yet alien. Animals, plants, they bore these days better than we. Some of them, at least. Mutated abominations, mad with pain and hunger. Sometimes I wonder if this is even that bad for them, if nature even sees this as any kind of setback. We’re gone, after all, and we were hardly her friend. Will the earth even remember us? Should it?

## Amended 'Cute' version

As above, but from the perspective of a small child. One day the sky was filled with magic, and all the grown ups started getting sleepy, even mummy and daddy. Our nice neighbour, Dr Henry, said I needed to on an adventure over the hills and far away - he thinks that there might be clues far away in the snow village! If I just follow the snowstar, I will find it. He even let me borrow his cool dog, Bendix! Bendix has a silver cape and a silver hat, just like me! He’s so handsome. Dr Henry said that it’s important that I stay with him, and keep him out of the rainbow-light when it gets bright, and not to eat strange fruit or drink bad water. I asked him why, but then he fell asleep too! Silly Dr Henry. 

There sure are a lot of tired grown-ups around. Some of them are cranky, too - they need a nap! 

Hrm, most of the grown ups seem asleep now. Others are mean and bossy, and wearing silly clothes. They always get angry at each other. Not at me, though. They just get sad when I tell them to stop being naughty. They can be good boys and girls too - if I help them, it helps them to remember to be good.

The grown-ups are hiding, I can’t even find many sleepy ones anymore. I’ve been a good girl, I have been taking good care of Bendix, and I have followed all of Dr Henry’s rules. BRRRRR I think we’re almost there, it’s pretty cold. 

Yay, I found the snow village! There are lots of people up here, and none of them are sleepy. They’re very friendly. Dr Henry was right! Some of the snow people are Doctors too, they’re going to help me look for clues to fix the sleepy bug, so all the grownups wake up. But first they need to check if I have the sleepy bug! They don’t even believe I came all the way from homeville. I did! Silly grownups.

Some time soon, as little as 80 years, perhaps 1000 years, the magnetic poles will reverse. This process happens once every 500 million years, and takes anywhere from as little as 100 years to 1000s of years, we’re not sure.

While it happens, the magnetic poles are going to go crazy. There’s probably going to be many of them for a while. During this process, the magnetosphere gets weaker. It already is. This will mean less shielding from solar wind and solar flares, which in turn means no electricity, and more genetic mutations. Shifting poles seem to be creating sea floor rises, undersea earthquakes, and tsunamis. 

Combine that with runaway global warming from the current age, rising sea levels, and melting polar ice caps.

Shifting magnetic fields currently have broad stronger zones over northern Canada, Siberia, and southern Australia/Antarctica. There’s a big weak zone over Africa and South America. This has remained pretty constant over centuries. Reduced magnetic fields could produce effects similar to solar storms; weirdly located aurora, radios stop working, electronics stop working or break due to power surges, all comms lines except fiber optic stop working (though fiber optics are usually connected to electronics), navigation systems fuck up, satellites are destroyed, humans get radiation doses (potentially lethal, depending on where - underground is safest), even pipelines get electric currents in them causing corrosion. Faraday cages (e.g. al foil lining) can provide protection as can being underground. Chainmail works (faraday suit, basically).

When the sky gets pretty, get the fuck underground.
