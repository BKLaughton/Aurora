# Aurora
Post apocalyptic setting based on a reversal of earth's magnetic poles, but told from the perspective of a small child, oblivious to the horror of it all as they make their way to a 'strong spot' in the unstable magnetosphere (on the advice of an elderly mentor doctor type). Probably an rpg/puzzle game with a children's storybook aesthetic. Project notes can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/BKLaughton/Aurora/wiki).
